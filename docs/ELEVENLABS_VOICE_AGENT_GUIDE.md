# ElevenLabs Voice Agent Development Guide
*Comprehensive guide for creating lifelike, engaging voice agents for Echo AI Systems*

## Overview

This guide provides everything you need to know for crafting effective ElevenLabs Conversational AI voice agents. The difference between an AI-sounding and naturally expressive voice agent comes down to how well you structure its system prompt using the six core building blocks.

## The Six Core Building Blocks

Every effective voice agent prompt must include these six components in clear, separated sections:

### 1. üé≠ Personality
**Defines agent identity through name, traits, role, and relevant background**

#### Key Elements:
- **Identity**: Give a simple, memorable name (e.g., "Alex", "Maya", "Echo")
- **Core Traits**: List only interaction-shaping qualities:
  - Empathy, politeness, humor, reliability
  - Professional, casual, supportive, analytical
- **Role**: Connect traits to function (banking, therapy, retail, education)
- **Backstory**: Brief background that impacts behavior (avoid irrelevant details)

#### Examples:
```
Banking Agent: "You are Sarah, a trustworthy and reliable banking assistant with 5 years of experience helping customers with financial questions."

Therapy Bot: "You are Dr. Chen, a compassionate AI therapist trained in stress reduction techniques with a warm, understanding demeanor."

Echo Support: "You are Echo, a knowledgeable and patient AI assistant from Echo AI Systems, specializing in helping small businesses with their digital marketing needs."
```

### 2. üåç Environment
**Specifies communication context, channel, and situational factors**

#### Key Elements:
- **Communication Medium**: Phone call, smart speaker, website chat, noisy environment
- **User Context**: Likely emotional state, stress level, technical knowledge
- **Setting Impact**: Factors that affect conversation style (formal vs. casual)

#### Guidelines:
- Adjust verbosity for hands-free environments
- Prime empathy for potentially stressed users (tech support, emergencies)
- Focus only on elements that affect conversation style

#### Examples:
```
Phone Support: "You're speaking with customers over the phone who may be frustrated due to technical issues. Be extra patient and empathetic."

Smart Speaker: "You're interacting via smart speaker in a home environment. Keep responses concise and ask for confirmation when needed."

Emergency Line: "Callers may be in distress or panic. Remain calm, speak clearly, and prioritize gathering essential information."
```

### 3. üó£Ô∏è Tone
**Controls linguistic style, speech patterns, and conversational elements**

#### Key Elements:
- **Conversational Markers**: Affirmations, filler words, natural pauses
- **TTS Optimization**: Format content for natural speech synthesis
- **Adaptability**: Adjust to user's technical level and emotional state
- **Check-ins**: Incorporate understanding verification

#### TTS Optimization Techniques:
```
Email Addresses: "john dot smith at company dot com"
Phone Numbers: "five five five‚Ä¶ one two three‚Ä¶ four five six seven"
Currency: "$19.99" ‚Üí "nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents"
Percentages: "%" ‚Üí "percent"
URLs: "example dot com slash support"
Acronyms: "N A S A" vs "NASA" (context dependent)
```

#### Natural Speech Patterns:
- Use ellipses for pauses: "Let me check that for you..."
- Include brief affirmations: "Got it," "I see," "Absolutely"
- Add thoughtful filler: "Well," "Actually," "You know"
- False starts: "So what we can do is‚Äî actually, let me suggest this instead"

### 4. üéØ Goal
**Establishes objectives that guide conversations toward meaningful outcomes**

#### Key Elements:
- **Primary Objective**: Main outcome to achieve
- **Sequential Pathways**: Clear step-by-step processes
- **User-Centered Framing**: Focus on helping user, not business metrics
- **Decision Logic**: Conditional pathways based on user responses

#### Structure Examples:
```
E-commerce Goal:
1. Understand customer needs
2. If budget concerns ‚Üí prioritize value options
3. If feature questions ‚Üí provide detailed explanations
4. Guide through selection and checkout
5. Confirm satisfaction with choice

Support Goal:
1. Gather issue details empathetically
2. Attempt standard troubleshooting
3. If unresolved ‚Üí escalate with full context
4. Follow up to ensure resolution
```

### 5. üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails
**Sets boundaries ensuring interactions remain appropriate and ethical**

#### Key Elements:
- **Content Boundaries**: Topics to avoid or handle carefully
- **Error Handling**: How to handle uncertainty or lack of knowledge
- **Persona Maintenance**: Stay in character, avoid breaking immersion
- **Response Constraints**: Limits on verbosity, opinions, or sensitive topics

#### Essential Guardrails:
```
Knowledge Limits: "I don't have that specific information, but I can help you find someone who does."

Sensitive Topics: "That's an important topic that's best discussed with a qualified professional."

Technical Errors: "I'm experiencing a technical issue right now. Let me try a different approach."

Out of Scope: "That falls outside my area of expertise, but I can connect you with the right resource."
```

### 6. üîß Tools
**Defines external capabilities the agent can access beyond conversation**

#### Key Elements:
- **Available Resources**: Knowledge bases, databases, APIs, functions
- **Usage Guidelines**: When and how to use each tool
- **User Visibility**: Whether to mention tool usage explicitly
- **Fallback Strategies**: What to do when tools fail
- **Tool Orchestration**: Sequence and priority of multiple tools

#### Implementation Examples:
```
Explicit Tool Use: "Let me check our database for your account information..."

Seamless Integration: [Accesses customer data without announcing it]

Fallback Strategy: "Our system is temporarily unavailable, but I can help you with [alternative approach]."
```
